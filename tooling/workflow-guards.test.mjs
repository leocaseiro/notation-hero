// tooling/workflow-guards.test.mjs — node --test suite asserting both privileged workflows keep the
// in-repo master-ref guard (NH-79 review). The deploy + seed workflows run with the owner/DDL Neon
// url; the GitHub `production` environment branch policy is the primary gate, but the in-repo
// `github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'` if-guard is the defence-in-depth layer the PR documents. This
// test pins it in source (mirrors infra/index.test.ts pinning the Function URL to AWS_IAM) so a
// future edit cannot silently drop the guard.
